The best teams measure visibility weekly, refresh content quarterly, and keep human and AI systems learning together in one loop.\n\nThe shift ahead is bigger than technology alone. Visibility now depends on how well your systems, workflows, and people operate as one connected engine. High-performing teams already think of this as a core operating principle, not a campaign.\n\nIf you are ready to see where your brand stands and what it will take to compete, our team can help.

Specifically:\n    1.    Systems over sprints\nThe original stresses that visibility is no longer about campaigns\u2014it\u2019s about building a connected engine of people, tools, and workflows.\n    2.

Positioning of AirOps\nThe closing of the section is a call to action that frames AirOps as a strategic partner for evaluating and improving visibility. Your summary omits this entirely.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf How to Improve to a 10/10\n\nIf you want a more complete and faithful summary, here\u2019s a tightened version that preserves the section\u2019s strategic depth:\n\nRevised 10/10 Summary:\nTo stay visible in AI search\u2014where the rules shift quarterly\u2014brands must operate with speed and structure. High-performing teams treat visibility as a continuous operating system, not a campaign: they measure performance weekly, refresh content quarterly, and keep human judgment and AI tools learning in one loop. The priority is building a connected engine across people, workflows, and systems\u2014not just producing more content.

limits (Twitter, LinkedIn)\n\nHigh\n\nImplement exponential backoff, use multiple API keys, cache aggressively\n\nScraping blocks (LinkedIn, some news sites)\n\nMedium\n\nRotate user agents, use residential proxies, respect robots.txt\n\nLLM costs spiral (too many calls)\n\nHigh\n\nCache similar queries, use smaller models for simple tasks, batch processing\n\nNoisy digests (too much info)\n\nMedium\n\nImplement relevance scoring, let users tune filters, A/B test digest length\n\nStale data (ingestion fails)\n\nMedium\n\nHealth monitoring, alerting, graceful degradation (skip source if down)\n\nHallucination (LLM makes up info)\n\nHigh\n\nAlways cite sources, validate claims against KB, flag low-confidence answers\n\nAlert fatigue (\"urgent\" alerts too frequent)\n\nMedium\n\nStrict thresholds for urgency, user feedback loop, weekly digest of \"urgent\" to tune\n\nSuccess Criteria & KPIs\n\nAdoption Metrics:\n\nDaily digest open rate: Target 80%\n\nQuery volume: Target 10+ per week\n\nFeedback score: Target 4.5+ / 5.0\n\nQuality Metrics:\n\nAnswer accuracy: Target 90%+ (validated by team feedback)\n\nFalse positive alerts: Target <5%\n\nResponse time: Target <30s for queries\n\nBusiness Impact:\n\nTime saved: Target 4+ hours per team member per week\n\nCompetitive insights surfaced: Target 10+ actionable insights per month\n\nFeatures shipped faster: Track time from \"competitor ships X\" to \"we ship Y\"\n\nOpen Questions\n\nWhich competitors should we track? (need prioritized list)\n\nWho has access to the Slackbot? (entire company vs. specific channels?)\n\nWhat's the budget for APIs/LLM calls? (will inform tech choices)\n\nExisting integrations to reuse? (GEO-12 mentioned - what APIs are already set up?)\n\nAdmin interface needed? (to add/remove competitors, tune agent behavior)\n\nPrivacy concerns? (especially with Slack message ingestion)\n\nLet me know if you want me to expand on any section or create specific technical specs (API designs, database schemas, etc.)!) I want you to make a md file of the general architectuee cur and todo\n",

    "where do we save the urls for the ingested sites? "
